## Overall Project Description

- This project is a website application where pizza lovers get to enjoy the variety while getting mouth watering cuisines at great offers. Through the app we get to manage our large volumes that trickle in on a daily basis and satisfy our every customers' need as well as go beyond to leave a form through which they can contact us and leave reviews.

- A user is then able to move to different areas like the Menu, List, About information and Contact.
- One is able to browse over the different kinds of pizzas that they would be interested in.
